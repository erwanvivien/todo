# Simple Todo APP

**Self hostable**. Easy. Fast.

You can use the dedicated website or host one yourself. In any case, I guarantee **data safety** and **data privacy**.

## Self-Host

Create a `.env` file following the simple `.env.example` and run:
```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```
As simple as that.
